    <h1> Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
    <li> JS is client-side Scripting Language.</li>
    <li> It was first named as 'Mocha' , then renamed to "LiveScript".</li>
    <li> Java was popular at that time , so it was decided that positioning a language as a "YOUNGER BROTHER" of JAVA
      would
      help, so it was again renamed to "JavaScript".</li>
    <li> Java and JavaScript are totally different Programming Language.</li>
